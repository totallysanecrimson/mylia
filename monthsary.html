  <h1>My Dearest Lia,</h1>

  <p>Happy monthsary, babi!!! Another month has passed, and while these past few months haven't been a walk in the park for us, they've only strengthened the bond we share. We've faced some serious hurdles, some unexpected storms, and maybe even a few existential crises thrown in for good measure. But through it all, I've learned something incredible: I'm so incredibly grateful to have you by my side. Your strength, your kindness, your unwavering love—it's all been my lifeline. Thank you for sticking with me, for weathering the storms with me, and for making even the toughest times feel a little less tough.</p>

  <p>Every moment with you feels like a gift, and today, I just want to pause and tell you how grateful I am for us. This time we’ve spent together—laughing, learning, growing—has been one of the most beautiful parts of my life. You make the simplest days feel special, and the hardest ones easier just by being there. Whether we’re talking for hours or just sitting in silence, I feel home when I’m with you. </p>

  <p>Thank you for loving me, for being patient, and for choosing me every day. I promise to keep choosing you too—in every version of tomorrow we’ll face.

Here’s to more months, more memories, and more love. I’m so lucky to have you, and even luckier to be yours. I love youuu so soooo muchhhh !!!! mwaa mwaaa >3< </p>
